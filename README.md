# Python-Intro-Workshop-2019

This workshop aims to teach the basic fundamentals of python. We will be coding using python 3 specifically, but most of the concepts apply to python 2 as well. We will go over variables, types, conditionals, loops, and basic functions in the course of the workshop. This will give you a good base to figure out how to start making your own simple functions and programs going forward as well as understanding other people's code you may encounter.

FOR THIS WORKSHOP YOU NEED:
    -Jupyter Notebook
    -Python 3.0 and above. (3.7 recommended)

    Download Anaconda (inlcuding Python and Juputer Notebook): https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
    
    OR
    
    Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

    Once you have python installed:
        -open command prompt
        -type: pip3 install jupyter 
   
If you run into an error message "pip not recognized", it means you do not have pip, which is what we use to install jupyter notebook here. Then run the commands below:

        curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
        
        python3 get-pip.py
        
These two lines of code will help you install pip. And then go back to the section above and run the command:
        
        pip3 install jupyter
